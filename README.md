# ticTacToe

A basic ticTacToe implementation.

I originally made it as a part of my portfolio, which is written in React, so I had to refactor back into Vanilla JS.

Currently it has a random AI implementation that will make a winning move if next move can result in a win.

Eventually I'll add a miniMax implementation as well.
